## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## How to Play
Memory game consists of eight different pairs of cards organized in a grid, each card has a unique symbol. The cards are organized randomly on the grid with a hidden symbol card. Therefore, the player can play by flipping over two hidden cards at a time to discover the ones that match!

if the player finished the game there is a modal going to show how much time the player consumed, how many stars he got and a button to allow him to click on it to play again.
